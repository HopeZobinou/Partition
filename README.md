# Partition
This program prompts the user for a file name, reads the array in the file and Partitions each it into 2 equal groups. If the array is not partitionable it will print out close results.
You need to have a txt file with a list of numbers in the same directory of the partition program. Ex: "ptest.txt" (contains a list of numbers): "12 33 10 3 7 11 1 2 3 6 9 1"
After the program runs it will create two more files in the directory that have the numbers split up into two equal groups.
